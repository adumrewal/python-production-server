# Python Production Server
## Flask, Elasticsearch, ElasticAPM, Docker, Logging, Config files

### Dependencies
- Flask: 2.0.1
- Flask_RESTful: 0.3.9
- Elasticsearch: 7.13.4 (I recommend not using 7.14.x as of now. There are some issues with that version when using with python client.)

To run this raw flask server, run `python run.py`
